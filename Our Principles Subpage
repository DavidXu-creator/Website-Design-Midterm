<legend>Our Vision</legend>  
<p>Over the past century, generations of talented Boeing employees helped build the world’s largest aerospace company—and shaped the course of history along the way. The Boeing Vision is an expression of our company’s purpose and values, designed to inspire and focus all employees on a shared future and to reaffirm that, together, we can meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
